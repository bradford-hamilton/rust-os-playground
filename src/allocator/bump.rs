//
// The most simple allocator design is a bump allocator (also known as stack allocator).
// It allocates memory linearly and only keeps track of the number of allocated bytes
// and the number of allocations. It is only useful in very specific use cases because
// it has a severe limitation: it can only free all memory at once.
//
// The big advantage of bump allocation is that it’s very fast. Compared to other allocator
// designs (see below) that need to actively look for a fitting memory block and perform
// various bookkeeping tasks on alloc and dealloc, a bump allocator can be optimized to
// just a few assembly instructions. This makes bump allocators useful for optimizing the
// allocation performance, for example when creating a virtual DOM library.
