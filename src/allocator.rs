// The responsibility of an allocator is to manage the available heap memory.
// It needs to return unused memory on alloc calls and keep track of memory
// freed by dealloc so that it can be reused again. Most importantly, it
// must never hand out memory that is already in use somewhere else because
// this would cause undefined behavior.

// Apart from correctness, there are many secondary design goals. For example,
// the allocator should effectively utilize the available memory and keep
// fragmentation low. Furthermore, it should work well for concurrent
// applications and scale to any number of processors. For maximal performance,
// it could even optimize the memory layout with respect to the CPU caches to
// improve cache locality and avoid false sharing.

    // Since align is a power of two, its binary representation has only a single bit set (e.g. 0b000100000).
    // This means that align - 1 has all the lower bits set (e.g. 0b00011111). By creating the bitwise NOT
    // through the ! operator, we get a number that has all the bits set except for the bits lower than align
    // (e.g. 0bâ€¦111111111100000). By performing a bitwise AND on an address and !(align - 1), we align the
    // address downwards. This works by clearing all the bits that are lower than align. Since we want to
    // align upwards instead of downwards, we increase the addr by align - 1 before performing the bitwise
    // AND. This way, already aligned addresses remain the same while non-aligned addresses are rounded to
    // the next alignment boundary.
